It is one of the widely-used automation testing best practices for verifying the behavior and efficiency of tests when handling various types of input values.

## Assertions  
The word Assert means to state a fact or belief confidently or forcefully. In Selenium, Asserts are validations or checkpoints for an application. Assertions state confidently that application behavior is working as expected. Asserts in Selenium validate the automated test cases that help testers understand if tests have passed or failed.

Types of Assertions
